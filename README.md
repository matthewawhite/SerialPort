# SerialPort
A serial port I developed for the purpose of controlling a hybrid autonomous/bluetooth controlled robot. I developed this serial port because the Arduino serial port didn't work for my implementation, as the Arduino serial port requires hitting enter each time to send a command, while this serial port automatically sends the data.

# To do
Look into implementation where data is sent after keyboard input instead of simply sending after a set time period, which will reduce any sent empty signals.
